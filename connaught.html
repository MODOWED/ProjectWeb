                <h2>3. Queen Maeve Trail – Knocknarea</h2>
                <p>The clear-cut limestone mountain of Knocknarea, located on the Cúil Irra (Coolera) peninsula, forms one of County Sligo’s most conspicuous landmarks. Knocknarea Mountain (320m) dominates the skyline of Sligo.
                     Formed from limestone over 300 million years ago, the summit is crowned by the great cairn of Queen Maeve (Miosgan Meadhbha) and has been an importance ritual focal point since Neolithic times. The presence
                      of the passage tombs, along with circular house foundations and an extensive system of earthen banks enclosing the eastern approach to the summit, are all reminders that this was a place of intensive activity.
                       The large cairn measuring some 55 meters across and 10 meters in height, was probably built around 3400BC, while some of the smaller passage tombs are potentially some one hundred years older.<a href="https://sligowalks.ie/walks/qmt/">Read More</a></p>

                    <h1>Top 5 Things to do in Munster</h1>
    
                    <h2>1. The Burren</h2>
                    <p>In the heart of the stark landscape stands the magnificent Poulnabrone Dolmen. A wedge tomb, it is the first of over 70 burial sites to be found in the Burren’s limestone uplands and consists of four upright stones supporting a thin capstone.

                        When the tomb was excavated in the 1960s, the remains of 20 adults, five children, and a newborn baby were uncovered. Subsequent carbon dating calculated the burials took place between 3800 and 3600 BC.

                    <h2>2. Cliffs of Moher</h2>
                    <p>The Cliffs of Moher are Ireland’s most visited natural attraction, with a magical vista that captures the hearts of up to one million visitors every year.

                        Standing 214 m (702 feet) at their highest point, they stretch for 8 kilometres (5 miles) along the Atlantic coast of County Clare in the west of Ireland.
                        
                        From the Cliffs of Moher on a clear day, you can see the Aran Islands and Galway Bay. You can also make out the Twelve Pins and the Maum Turk Mountains in Connemara, as well as Loop Head to the south and the Dingle Peninsula and Blasket Islands in Kerry.</p>
